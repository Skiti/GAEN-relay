# GAEN-relay

GAEN-relay is a mobile app developed from Vhiribarren's Beacon Simulator (https://github.com/vhiribarren/beacon-simulator-android).

I customized the code in order to detect Google Apple Exposure Notification packets, specifically ones from Immuni app. The app can duplicate those packets, alter their data, relay them to other GAEN-relay apps through an internet database and broadcast the duplicated packets.

GAEN-relay is a practical demonstration about how easily GAEN-based contact tracing apps can be exploited through relay attacks.
